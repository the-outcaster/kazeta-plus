# Kazeta+
The "overly complex" fork of the original [Kazeta](https://github.com/kazetaos/kazeta) project.

Features:
- multi-cart support
- [optical disc drive support](https://github.com/the-outcaster/kazeta-plus/wiki/Creating-Optical-Disc-Media) (CDs, DVDs, etc)
  - music CD player support
- multi-resolution support
- multi-audio sink support, with adjustable volume controls
- OTA update support
- battery monitoring and clock display
- customization of the BIOS, from the fonts, backgrounds, logos, and everything in-between
- theme support; users can download themes from a [community-oriented repo](https://github.com/the-outcaster/kazeta-plus-themes) directly from the BIOS, or [make their own](https://github.com/the-outcaster/kazeta-plus-theme-creator)
- Steam Deck volume control and brightness control support
- Bluetooth controller support
- native GameCube controller adapter support, overclocked to 1,000 Hz

Improvements:
- updated [runtimes](https://github.com/the-outcaster/kazeta-plus/wiki/Runtimes) for Linux and Windows, plus emulator runtimes for other systems
- no need to store runtimes on your removable media; runtimes can be downloaded directly to the hard drive for faster load times, while also saving space on your disc/removable media
- easier troubleshooting thanks to a button on the main menu to copy the session logs over to the user's SD card, as opposed to having to copy them manually via the terminal

Fixes:
- fixes for missing fonts in certain applications (and may even fix apps that only had a black screen)
- [D-pad reversal fix](https://github.com/the-outcaster/kazeta-plus/wiki/Applying-D%E2%80%90Pad-Reversal-Fix) for native Linux games
